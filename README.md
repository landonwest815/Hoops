## Project Overview
The Hoops App is a very simplistic watch app to track your basketball shooting. Getting some shops up? Open the app on your watch, select a shot type (ex. Three Pointers), choose a session length, and press "Start". It is as easy as that. When your session is up, you'll get results with an average shots made per minute.
This data gets sent to the iOS app and is viewable on a chart to see how you improve over time. (iOS Companion App still in development)

### Key Features
- **Choosing Shot Type**: Scroll through the various options of shot types. The shot range is color coded for easier selection.
- **Selecting Session Length**: Simply scroll through the preset lengths to set how long you want to shoot that shot type for.
- **Logging Made Shots**: Upon Session start, all you have to do is tap the watch screen to log a made shot. This button fills the bottom 3/4 of the screen for ease of tapping.
- **Post-Session Stats**: Once your session has concluded, you will be shown your stats. This includes time, makes, and average per minute.

With its simple design, the Hoops Watch App not only makes it easy to track your shooting sessions, but you are also given many options for different areas in basketball. Seeing how you improve or decline over time is made easy with the iOS Companion App (still in development)
