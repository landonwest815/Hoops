## Project Overview
Hoops is a very simplistic Watch App to track your basketball shooting. Getting some shops up? Open the app on your watch, select a shot type (ex. Three Pointers), and press start hoopin'. It's as easy as that. When you feel like your session is up, you can stop the timer and view your results. These results involve an average shots made per minute as well as your makes and session length used to calculate that average.
This data gets sent to the iOS Companion App and becomes viewable on customizable charts to see how your averages progress over time.

### Key Features
- **Choosing Shot Type**: Scroll through the various options of shot types. The shot range is color coded for easier selection.
- **Logging Made Shots**: Upon Session start, all you have to do is tap the watch screen to log a made shot. This button fills the bottom 3/4 of the screen for ease of tapping.
- **Post-Session Stats**: Once your session has concluded, you will be shown your stats. This includes time, makes, and average per minute.
- **Viewing Data in iOS App**: Hoops Data is immediately transferred to your iPhone, allowing you to view all your statistics. You can filter by days, shot types, session lengths, and so much more.

With its simple design, the Hoops Watch App not only makes it easy to track your sessions, but you are also given so many options for different areas in basketball. Seeing how you improve or decline over time is made easy with the iOS Companion App.

Note: These features may or may not be implemented yet. Stay tuned.
